## NicoCourts.com Backend
This is a mini server written in Go that handles requests from the frontend as well as provding a central repository for the blog posts.

# Plans
I would like this to provide a JSON interface to be read by the front end and to provide an API for creating new posts that uses cryptographic signatures to verify they were posted by me.

I will have the backend convert all files to markdown with LaTeX to be posted. They will be accepted in and converted from
-Plaintext
-LaTeX source
-Markdown
